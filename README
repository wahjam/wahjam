How to build the Qt client
--------------------------

Install the Qt cross-platform application and UI toolkit from http://qt.nokia.com/.

Install Ogg and Vorbis audio codec libraries from http://xiph.org/.

Then run the following commands:

  cd ninjam/wahjam
  qmake
  make

On Windows the recommended build environment for libogg and libvorbis is MinGW
and MSYS from http://www.mingw.org/.  Build libogg and libvorbis inside MSYS,
then use the Qt build environment to compile qtclient.  You may need to add the
MSYS include/ and lib/ paths as QMAKE_CXXFLAGS -I and LIBS -L flags in
ninjam/qtclient/qtclient.pro.

How to build the other software
-------------------------------

To build a particular target change into its directory and run make(1).  For
the Mac OS X cocoaclient an Xcode project is available.  For the Windows
winclient a Visual Studio project is available.

Cross-compiling the Qt client for Windows
-----------------------------------------

The MinGW compiler can be used as a cross-compiler to build Windows executables
from a Linux host.  This allows us to set up a Linux build server capable of
building Windows executables.

The mingw-cross-env project provides a cross-compiler and many popular
libraries, including Wahjam's dependencies on ogg, vorbis, the Qt framework,
and PortAudio.  At the time of writing the latest release of mingw-cross-env
had some dead URLs so the current development version was used from their
mercurial repository.

1. Clone mingw-cross-env:

  hg clone http://hg.savannah.nongnu.org/hgweb/mingw-cross-env

1. Build the cross-compiler and dependencies:

  cd mingw-cross-env
  make gcc ogg vorbis qt portaudio

1. If you encounter any build errors try reducing optional dependencies.

For example, try disabling SQL drivers and DBUS on the ./configure line in
mingw-cross-env/src/qt.mk.

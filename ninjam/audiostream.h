/*

  This header is used by Wahjam clients to define an abstract audio streamer interface, as
  well as declare functions for creating instances of these audio streamers. 

  On Windows, these functions are primarily called from audioconfig.cpp, and on
  the Cocoa client the function is called from Controller.mm.

  The basic structure is:

  The client runs, creates an audiostreamer (below), giving it a SPLPROC, which is it's
  own function that then in turn calls NJClient::AudioProc. 

  But this is just the interface declaration etc.
